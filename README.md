> Build A Vue & Laravel Single-Page CRUD App

In this tutorial, I'll show you how to set up a full-stack Vue 2.6 SPA with Laravel 6 backend including each of the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete).

AJAX is key to this architecture, so we'll use Axios as the HTTP client. I'll also show you some strategies for dealing with the UX pitfalls of this architecture.

It'd be a good idea to follow along with the simple demo app that can be found in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/anthonygore/vue-laravel-crud).
